    "## TrafficGraph Class Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The `TrafficGraph` class is a key component route optimization system we have divised, the class is designed to address the challenges of navigating during peak traffic times. In this case we used a specifice instance, travelling from UCD to Westmeath.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic Edge Weights**: The idea of the edges is to reflect fluctuating travel times which would be prevelant in rela world scenarios. A function of the graph is updating the edge weights to represent current travel times, ensuring that the routing suggestions are both timely and context-aware.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pathfinding with Dijkstra's Algorithm**: We deployed Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path through the graph. The desire is that the system is as accuracte and efficient as possible so it can be utilised in real world situations, thus the algorithm's efficiency is crucial for maintaining quick response times essential for real-time routing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Google Maps API**: We are utilizing real-time traffic data from Google Maps API to ensures that the route suggestions are based on the most current conditions available. This aligns with our goal to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the navigation system.\n"

    "As seen in the cell above we initialize the `TrafficGraph` instance for Dublin. This graph represents a network of key locations on the route outlined, connected by directed edges that simulate possible driving routes between these points. The nodes and edges have been specifically set up to reflect a route from UCD to Westmeath.\n",

    "Edges between nodes are directed and come with weights, see below for a breakdown of the edges:\n",

    "- **Edge Weights**: Thes nodes are initally static in the setup and represent the average time (in minutes) to travel from one node to another under typical conditions.\n",
    "- **Routes**: Each edge signifies a possible route a driver might take. For example, moving from \"UCD Village\" to \"Fosters Avenue\" takes approximately 10 minutes under normal conditions.\n",

    "### Purpose and Use\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of setting up this graph is to facilitate the optimization of route finding from UCD to Westmeath, particularly during rush hour, utilizing alternate routes when necessary. This setup will allow us to apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path efficiently and can be adapted to include real-time traffic data, enhancing the route recommendations dynamically."

    "## Performance Comparison between Route Finder and Google Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "This section outlines a testing procedure designed to compare the efficiency and accuracy of our route optimization system against Google Maps. We conduct this comparison under varying traffic conditions simulated over a specific time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Range for Simulation**: We simulate travel times over a range of timestamps. The interval as can be seen is every 30 minutes. This range covers peak and off-peak hours, providing a comprehensive view of both systems' performance under diverse traffic conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Fetching**: For each timestamp:\n",
    "  - Fetch the travel time from Google Maps for a fixed route from \"8Q3F+XG5 Dublin\" to \"7QC5+32C Dublin\".\n",
    "  - Simultaneously update our graph's edge weights with real-time data and compute the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Comparison Metrics**:\n",
    "  - **Travel Time**: Direct comparison of the travel times estimated by Google Maps and our Route Finder.\n",
    "  - **Performance Advantage**: Determining which system provides a quicker route and quantifying the time difference.\n",

    "## Performance Comparison Summary: Route Finder vs. Google Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overall Superiority**: The Route Finder was faster than Google Maps in 19 out of 20 comparisons. This demonstrates a significant and consistent advantage in finding quicker routes under various traffic conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consistency and Reliability**: The consistency in Route Finder's performance, with it being the faster option in 95% of the tests, underscores its effectiveness at navigating through, or around, traffic more efficiently than Google Maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Significant Time Savings**: The largest time saving observed was 85 seconds, with the Route Finder reducing travel time by approximately 10% compared to Google at 20:30. The smallest notable advantage was a 24-second improvement at 23:00.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exception Case**: At 23:30, Google Maps provided a slightly better route, faster by 7 seconds. This indicates that while Route Finder generally performs better, there may be specific conditions under which Google Maps optimizes routes more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Average Time Difference**: The average time difference across all comparisons favored the Route Finder by 62.70 seconds. This suggests that, on average, users could expect a more than one-minute faster travel time using Route Finder compared to Google Maps during these testing hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Total Comparisons**: 20\n",
    "- **Google Faster**: 1 case\n",
    "- **Route Finder Faster**: 19 cases\n",
    "- **Times Equal**: 0 cases\n",
    "- **Average Time Difference**: The Route Finder provided an average time saving of 62.70 seconds across all tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis and Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The data indicates that the Route Finder consistently outperforms Google Maps, particularly during peak traffic hours, by effectively. This performance advantage underscores the system's utility for daily commuters and logistic operations seeking efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Daily Commuting**: Regular commuters could expect significant daily time savings.\n",
    "- **Emergency and Logistics**: Enhanced route efficiency can critically benefit emergency response and delivery services by reducing travel times.\n",
